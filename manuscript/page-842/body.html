<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Scott's own poetry is strongly modeled upon these early ballads, and his <em>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</em> is due chiefly to the influence of Percy's work.</p><p>Besides the <em>Reliques</em>, Percy has given us another good work in his <em>Northern Antiquities</em> (1770) translated from the French of Mallet's <em>History of Denmark</em>. This also was of immense influence, since it introduced to English readers a new and fascinating mythology, more rugged and primitive than that of the Greeks; and we are still, in music as in letters, under the spell of Thor and Odin, of Frea and the Valkyr maidens, and of that stupendous drama of passion and tragedy which ended in the "Twilight of the Gods." The literary world owes a debt of gratitude to Percy, who wrote nothing of importance himself, but who, by collecting and translating the works of other men, did much to hasten the triumph of Romanticism in the nineteenth century.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
