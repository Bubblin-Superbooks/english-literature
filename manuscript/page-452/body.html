The part relating to England and Scotland was published, in Latin, in 1559 under a title as sonorous and impressive as the Roman office for the dead,â€”<em>Rerum in Ecclesia Gestarum Maximarumque per Europam Persecutionum Commentarii</em>. On his return to England Foxe translated this work, calling it the <em>Acts and Monuments</em>; but it soon became known as the <em>Book of Martyrs</em>, and so it will always be called. Foxe's own bitter experience causes him to write with more heat and indignation than his saintly theme would warrant, and the "holy tone" sometimes spoils a narrative that would be impressive in its bare simplicity. Nevertheless the book has made for itself a secure place in our literature. It is strongest in its record of humble men, like Rowland Taylor and Thomas Hawkes, whose sublime heroism, but for this narrative, would have been lost amid the great names and the great events that fill the Elizabethan Age.</p></ul></div> </div>
