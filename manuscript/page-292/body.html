And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,  
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne  
Of swarming bees, did cast him in a swowne.  
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,  
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,  
Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,  
Wrapt in eternal silence farre from enimyes.  </code></pre></blockquote><p>The description of Una shows the poet's sense of ideal beauty:</p><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>One day, nigh wearie of the yrkesome way,  
From her unhastie beast she did alight;  
And on the grasse her dainty limbs did lay  
In secrete shadow, far from all mens sight;  
From her fayre head her fillet she undight,  
And layd her stole aside; Her angels face,  
As the great eye of heaven, shyn√©d bright,  
And made a sunshine in the shady place;  </code></pre>
<p>Did never mortall eye behold such heavenly grace.<br>   </blockquote></div> </div>
