<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>Piping down the valleys wild,<br>    Piping songs of pleasant glee,<br>On a cloud I saw a child,<br>    And he laughing said to me:<br>"Pipe a song about a lamb;"<br>    So I piped with merry cheer.<br>"Piper, pipe that song again;"<br>    So I piped:, he wept to hear.<br>"Piper, sit thee down and write<br>    In a book, that all may read;"<br>So he vanished from my sight,<br>    And I plucked a hollow reed,<br>And I made a rural pen,<br>    And I stained the water clear,<br>And I wrote my happy songs<br>    Every child may joy to hear.  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
