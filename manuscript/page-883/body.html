That is true, so far as the satyr is concerned; for a more weazened, unlovely personality would be hard to find. The only question in the comparison is in regard to the character of the odors, and that is a matter of taste. In his work he is the reverse of Smollett, the latter being given over to coarse vulgarities, which are often mistaken for realism; the former to whims and vagaries and sentimental tears, which frequently only disguise a sneer at human grief and pity.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Sterne's WorkThe two books by which Sterne is remembered are <em>Tristram Shandy</em> and <em>A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy</em>. These are termed novels for the simple reason that we know not what else</p></div> </div>
