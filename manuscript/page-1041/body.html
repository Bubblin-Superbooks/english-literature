<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">buffoonery, which ruins our first splendid impression of his poetry.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Longer PoemsByron's later volumes, <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Cain</em>, the one a curious, and perhaps unconscious, parody of <em>Faust</em>, the other of <em>Paradise Lost</em>, are his two best known dramatic works. Aside from the question of their poetic value, they are interesting as voicing Byron's excessive individualism and his rebellion against society. The best known and the most readable of Byron's works <em>Mazeppa, The Prisoner of Chillon</em>, and <em>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</em>. The first two cantos of <em>Childe Harold</em> (1812) are perhaps more frequently read than any other work of the same author, partly because of their melodious verse, partly because of their descriptions of places along the lines of European travel; but the last two cantos (1816-1818) written after his exile from England, have more sincerity, and are in every way better expressions of Byron's mature genius.</p></div> </div>
