<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,<br>The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,<br>With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;<br>Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,<br>Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste<br>Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,<br>Told of a many thousand warlike French<br>That were embattailed and ranked in Kent.  </p></blockquote><p>Such passages suggest not only genius but also a keen, sympathetic observer, whose eyes see every significant detail. So with the nurse in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, whose endless gossip and vulgarity cannot quite hide a kind heart. She is simply the reflection of some forgotten nurse with whom Shakespeare had talked by the wayside.</p></div> </div>
