<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>A thing of beauty is a joy forever;<br>Its loveliness increases; it will never<br>Pass into nothingness; but still will keep<br>A bower quiet for us; and a sleep<br>Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing,<br>which well illustrate the spirit of Keats's later work, with its perfect finish and melody. It has many quotable lines and passages, and its "Hymn to Pan" should be read in connection with Wordsworth's famous sonnet beginning, "The world is too much with us." The poem gives splendid promise, but as a whole it is rather chaotic, with too much ornament and too little design, like a modern house. That Keats felt this defect strongly is evident from his modest preface, wherein he speaks of <em>Endymion</em>, not as a deed accomplished, but only as an unsuccessful attempt to suggest the underlying beauty of Greek mythology.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
