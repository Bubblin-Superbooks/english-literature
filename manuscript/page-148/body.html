All the scholarly works of the period, like William of Malmesbury's <em>History</em>, and Anselm's <em>Cur Deus Homo</em>, and Roger Bacon's <em>Opus Majus</em>, the beginning of modern experimental science, were written in Latin; while nearly all other works were written in French, or else were English copies or translations of French originals.
