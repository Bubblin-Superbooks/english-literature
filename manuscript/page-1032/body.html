Out of the day and night<br>A joy has taken flight;<br>    Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar,<br>Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight<br>    No more—oh, never more!  </p></blockquote><p>In 1822, when only thirty years of age, Shelley was drowned while sailing in a small boat off the Italian coast. His body was washed ashore several days later, and was cremated, near Viareggio, by his friends, Byron, Hunt, and Trelawney. His ashes might, with all reverence, have been given to the winds that he loved and that were a symbol of his restless spirit; instead, they found a resting place near the grave of Keats, in the English cemetery at Rome. One rarely visits the spot now without finding English and American visitors standing in silence before the significant inscription, <em>Cor Cordium</em>.</p></ul></div> </div>
