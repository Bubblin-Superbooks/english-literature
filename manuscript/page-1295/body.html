Macaulay is famous in literature for his essays, for his martial ballads, and for his <em>History of England</em>. His first important work, the <em>Essay on Milton</em> (1825), is worthy of study not only for itself, as a critical estimate of the Puritan poet, but as a key to all Macaulay's writings. Here, first of all, is an interesting work, which, however much we differ from the author's opinion, holds our attention and generally makes us regret that the end comes so soon. The second thing to note is the historical flavor of the essay. We study not only Milton, but also the times in which he lived, and the great movements of which he was a part. History and literature properly belong</p></div> </div>
