<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">pair of lines must contain a complete thought, stated as precisely as possible. Thus Waller writes:</p><blockquote><p>The soul's dark cottage, battered and decayed,<br>Lets in new light through chinks that time has made.  </p></blockquote><p>That is a kind of aphorism such as Pope made in large quantities in the following age. It contains a thought, is catchy, quotable, easy to remember; and the Restoration writers delighted in it. Soon this mechanical closed couplet, in which the second line was often made first, almost excluded all other forms of poetry. It was dominant in England for a full century, and we have grown familiar with it, and somewhat weary of its monotony, in such famous poems as Pope's "Essay on Man" and Goldsmith's "Deserted Village." These, however, are essays rather than poems. That even the couplet is capable of melody and variety is shown in Chaucer's <em>Tales</em> and in Keats's exquisite <em>Endymion</em>.</p></div> </div>
