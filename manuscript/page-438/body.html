<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5 class="no-indent  ">Aristotelian Logic. To Find Truth One Must Do Two Things: (<Em>a</em> Get Rid Of All Prejudices Or Idols, As Bacon Called Them. These "Idols" Are Four: "Idols Of The Tribe," That Is, Prejudices Due To Common Methods Of Thought Among All Races; "Idols Of The Cave Or Den," That Is, Personal Peculiarities And Prejudices; "Idols Of The Market Place," Due To Errors Of Language; And "Idols Of The Theater," Which Are The Unreliable Traditions Of Men. (<Em>b</em>) After Discarding The Above "Idols" We Must Interrogate Nature; Must Collect Facts By Means Of Numerous Experiments, Arrange Them In Order, And Then Determine The Law That Underlies Them.)</h5><p>It will be seen at a glance that the above is the most important of Bacon's works. The <em>Organum</em> was to be in several books, only two of which he completed, and these he wrote and rewrote twelve times until they satisfied him.</p></div> </div>
