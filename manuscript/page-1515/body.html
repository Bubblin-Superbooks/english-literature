Macpherson used these as a basis for his epic, but most of the details were furnished by his own imagination. The alleged text of "Ossian" was published in 1807, some eleven years after Macpherson's death. It only added another mystery to the forgery; for, while it embodied a few old and probably genuine fragments, the bulk of it seems to be Macpherson's work translated back into Gaelic.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For various other collections of songs and ballads, antedating Percy's, see Phelps's <em>Beginnings of the English</em></p></div> </div>
