<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>English IdylsEntirely different in spirit is another collection of poems called <em>English Idyls,</em> which began in the <em>Poems</em> of 1842, and which Tennyson intended should reflect the ideals of widely different types of English life. Of these varied poems, "Dora," "The Gardener's Daughter," "Ulysses," "Locksley Hall" and "Sir Galahad" are the best; but all are worthy of study. One of the most famous of this series is "Enoch Arden" (1864), in which Tennyson turns from medi√¶val knights, from lords, heroes, and fair ladies, to find the material for true poetry among the lowly people that make up the bulk of English life. Its rare melody, its sympathy for common life, and its revelation of the beauty and heroism which hide in humble men and women everywhere, made this work an instant favorite. Judged by its sales alone, it was the most popular of his works during the poet's lifetime.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Tennyson's later volumes, like the <em>Ballads</em> (1880)</p></div> </div>
