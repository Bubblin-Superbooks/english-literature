Thus Goldsmith followed Johnson and opposed the romanticists; but his <em>Deserted Village</em> is romantic in spirit, though its classic couplets are almost as mechanical as Pope's. So Burke's orations are "elegantly classic" in style, but are illumined by bursts of emotion and romantic feeling.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A much more interesting work is Thomas Paine's <em>Rights of Man</em>, which was written in answer to Burke's essay, and which had enormous influence in England</p></div> </div>
