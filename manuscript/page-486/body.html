<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">literature is intensely romantic; the romance springs from the heart of youth, and believes all things, even the impossible. The great schoolman's <em>credo</em>, "I believe because it is impossible," is a better expression of Elizabethan literature than of medi√¶val theology. In the literature of the Puritan period one looks in vain for romantic ardor. Even in the lyrics and love poems a critical, intellectual spirit takes its place, and whatever romance asserts itself is in form rather than in feeling, a fantastic and artificial adornment of speech rather than the natural utterance of a heart in which sentiment is so strong and true that poetry is its only expression.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
