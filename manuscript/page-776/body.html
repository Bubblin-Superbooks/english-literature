<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Taken together, Gray's works form a most interesting commentary on the varied life of the eighteenth century. He was a scholar, familiar with all the intellectual interests of his age, and his work has much of the precision and polish of the classical school; but he shares also the reawakened interest in nature, in common man, and in medi√¶val culture, and his work is generally romantic both in style and in spirit. The same conflict between the classic and romantic schools, and the triumph of Romanticism, is shown clearly in the most versatile of Gray's contemporaries, Oliver Goldsmith.</p><p>OLIVER GOLDSMITH (1728-1774)</p><p><a href="images/el035.png">Illustration: OLIVER GOLDSMITH</a></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
