As it is written, "Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart." Whatever the defects of Carlyle and his work, in his heart he was always planning a house or temple to the God of truth and justice.</p><p>Carlyle's important works may be divided into three general classes,â€”critical and literary essays, historical works, and <em>Sartor Resartus</em>, the last being in a class by itself, since there is nothing like it in literature. To these should be added a biography, the admirable <em>Life of John Sterling</em>, and Carlyle's <em>Letters</em> and <em>Reminiscences</em>, which are more interesting and suggestive than some of his better known works. We omit here all consideration of translations, and his intemperate denunciations of men and institutions in <em>Chartism, Latter-Day Pamphlets</em>, and other essays, which add nothing to the author's fame or influence.</p></div> </div>
