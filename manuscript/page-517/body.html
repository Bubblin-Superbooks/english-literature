<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">(From Wordsworth's "Sonnet on Milton")<br>Shakespeare and Milton are the two figures that tower conspicuously above the goodly fellowship of men who have made our literature famous. Each is representative of the age that produced him, and together they form a suggestive commentary upon the two forces that rule our humanity,â€”the force of impulse and the force of a fixed purpose. Shakespeare is the poet of impulse, of the loves, hates, fears, jealousies, and ambitions that swayed the men of his age. Milton is the poet of steadfast will and purpose, who moves like a god amid the fears and hopes and changing impulses of the world, regarding them as trivial and momentary things that can never swerve a great soul from its course.</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It is well to have some such comparison in mind</p></div> </div>
