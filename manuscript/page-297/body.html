Ycladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,  
Wherein old dints of deepe woundes did remaine  
The cruell markes of many a bloody fielde;  
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:  
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,  
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:  
Full iolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,  
  As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.  
And on his brest a bloodie crosse he bore,  
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,  
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,  
And dead, as living ever, him ador'd:  
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd, </blockquote></div> </div>
