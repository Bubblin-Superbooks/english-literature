LUKE'S GOSPEL, <em>CIR</em>. 700 A.D.</p><p>BEDE (673-735)</p><p>The Venerable Bede, as he is generally called, our first great scholar and "the father of our English learning," wrote almost exclusively in Latin, his last work, the translation of the Gospel of John into Anglo-Saxon, having been unfortunately lost. Much to our regret, therefore, his books and the story of his gentle, heroic life must be excluded from this history of our literature. His works, over forty in number, covered the whole field of human knowledge in his day, and were so admirably written that they were widely copied as text-books, or rather manuscripts, in nearly all the monastery schools of Europe.</p><p><a href="images/%7B8063%7D.jpg">{8063} </a></p></div> </div>
