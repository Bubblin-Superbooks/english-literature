<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">such a brief work as this. Outwardly they suggest a huge chaff pile, and the scattered grains of wheat hardly warrant the labor of winnowing. The curious reader will get an idea of Blake's amazing mysticism by dipping into any of the works of his middle life,—<em>Urizen, Gates of Paradise, Marriage of Heaven and Hell, America, The French Revolution</em>, or <em>The Vision of the Daughters of Albion</em>. His latest works, like <em>Jerusalem</em> and <em>Milton</em>, are too obscure to have any literary value. To read any of these works casually is to call the author a madman; to study them, remembering Blake's songs and his genius, is to quote softly his own answer to the child who asked about the land of dreams:</p><blockquote class="  "><p>"O what land is the land of dreams,<br>What are its mountains and what are its streams?<br>\—O father, I saw my mother</blockquote></div> </div>
