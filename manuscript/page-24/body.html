A hundred men may pass a hayfield and see only the sweaty toil and the windrows of dried grass; but here is one who pauses by a Roumanian meadow, where girls are making hay and singing as they work. He looks deeper, sees truth and beauty where we see only dead grass, and he reflects what he sees in a little poem in which the hay tells its own story:</p><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>Yesterday's flowers am I,  </code></pre>
<p>And I have drunk my last sweet draught of dew.<br>Young maidens came and sang me to my death;<br>The moon looks down and sees me in my shroud,<br>    The shroud of my last dew.<br>Yesterday's flowers that are yet in me<br>Must needs make way for all to-morrow's</blockquote></div> </div>
