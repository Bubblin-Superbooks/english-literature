<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  "><em>Silent Woman. Volpone</em> is a keen and merciless analysis of a man governed by an overwhelming love of money for its own sake. The first words in the first scene are a key to the whole comedy:</p><blockquote><p><em>(Volpone)</em><br>        Good morning to the day; and next, my gold!  
        Open the shrine that I may see my saint.<br>                (<em>Mosca withdraws a curtain and discovers piles of<br>                  gold, plate, jewels, etc.</em>)  
        Hail the world's soul, and mine!  </p></blockquote><p>Volpone's method of increasing his wealth is to play upon the avarice of men. He pretends to be at the point of death, and his "suitors," who know his love of gain and that he has no heirs, endeavor hypocritically to sweeten his last moments by giving him rich presents, so that he will leave them all his wealth. The intrigues of these suitors furnish the story of the play, and show to what infamous depths avarice will lead a man.</p></div> </div>
