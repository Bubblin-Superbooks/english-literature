<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">revival of romantic poetry in the eighteenth century.</p><p>THOMAS GRAY (1716-1771)</p><blockquote><p>The curfew tolls the knell of parting day;<br>The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea;<br>The plowman homeward plods his weary way,<br>And leaves the world to darkness and to me.<br>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,<br>And all the air a solemn stillness holds,<br>Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,<br>And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds.<br>So begins "the best known poem in the English language," a poem full of the gentle melancholy which marks all early romantic poetry. It should be read entire, as a perfect model of its kind. Not even Milton's "Il Penseroso," which it strongly suggests, excels it in beauty and suggestiveness.</p></blockquote></ul></div> </div>
