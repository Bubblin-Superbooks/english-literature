Its general subject is the Celtic legends of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, and the chief source of its material is Malory's <em>Morte d'Arthur</em>. Here, in this mass of beautiful legends, is certainly the subject of a great national epic; yet after four hundred years, during which many poets have used the material, the great epic is still unwritten. Milton and Spenser, as we have already noted, considered this material carefully; and Milton alone, of all English writers, had perhaps the power to use it in a great epic. Tennyson began to use these legends in his <em>Morte d'Arthur</em> (1842); but the epic idea probably occurred to him later, in 1856, when he began "Geraint and Enid," and he added the stories of "Vivien," "Elaine," "Guinevere," and other heroes and heroines at intervals, until "Balin," the last of the <em>Idylls</em>, appeared in 1885. Later these works were gathered</p></div> </div>
