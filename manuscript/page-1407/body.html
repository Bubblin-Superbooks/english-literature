At the beginning of the course the teacher, or the home student, should write for the latest catalogue of such publications as the Standard English Classics, Everyman's Library, etc., which offer a very wide range of reading at small cost. Nearly every publishing house issues a series of good English books for school use, and the list is constantly increasing.</p><ul><li>History</li></ul><p><em>Text-books:</em> Montgomery's English History; Cheyney's Short History of England (Ginn and Company).</p></div> </div>
