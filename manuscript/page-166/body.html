He dreams there, and the dream grows into a vision beautiful. His body lies still upon the grave while his spirit goes to a land, exquisite beyond all words, where he comes suddenly upon a stream that he cannot cross. As he wanders along the bank, seeking in vain for a ford, a marvel rises before his eyes, a crystal cliff, and seated beneath it a little maiden who raises a happy, shining face,â€”the face of his little Margaret.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>More then me lyste my drede aros,<br>I stod full stylle and dorste not</blockquote></div> </div>
