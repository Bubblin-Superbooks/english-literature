<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">the subtle call of the sea. The second part is an allegory, in which the troubles of the seaman are symbols of the troubles of this life, and the call of the ocean is the call in the soul to be up and away to its true home with God.
