Of Four Parts Of This Work Which He Completed, One Of Them At Least, The <Em>sylva Sylvarum</em>, Is Decidedly At Variance With His Own Idea Of Fact And Experiment. It Abounds In Fanciful Explanations, More Worthy Of The Poetic Than Of The Scientific Mind. Nature Is Seen To Be Full Of Desires And Instincts; The Air "Thirsts" For Light And Fragrance; Bodies Rise Or Sink Because They Have An "Appetite" For Height Or Depth; The Qualities Of Bodies Are The Result Of An "Essence," So That When We Discover The Essences Of Gold And Silver And Diamonds It Will Be A Simple Matter To Create As Much Of Them As We May Need.</h5><h5><Em>scala Intellectus</em>, Or "Ladder Of The Mind," Is The Rational Application Of The <Em>organum</em> To All Problems.
