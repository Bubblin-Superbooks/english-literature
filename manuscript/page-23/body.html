He looks deeper, sees truth and beauty where we see only dead grass, and he reflects what he sees in a little poem in which the hay tells its own story:</p><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>Yesterday's flowers am I,  </code></pre>
<p>And I have drunk my last sweet draught of dew.<br>Young maidens came and sang me to my death;<br>The moon looks down and sees me in my shroud,<br>    The shroud of my last dew.<br>Yesterday's flowers that are yet in me<br>Must needs make way for all to-morrow's flowers.<br>The maidens, too, that sang me to my death<br>Must even so make way for all the maids<br>    That are to come.<br>And as my soul, so too their soul will be<br>Laden with fragrance of the days gone</blockquote></div> </div>
