While "classic" or "pseudo-classic" may apply to a part of eighteenth-century literature, every age has both its romantic and its classic movements. In this period the revolt against classicism is shown in the revival of romantic poetry under Gray, Collins, Burns, and Thomson, and in the beginning of the English novel under Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding. These poets and novelists, who have little or no connection with classicism, belong chronologically to the period we are studying. They are reserved for special treatment in the sections following.</p><p>Pope's satires, for instance, are strongly suggested in Boileau; his <em>Rape of the Lock</em> is much like the mock-heroic <em>Le Lutrin;</em> and the "Essay on Criticism," which made him famous, is an English edition and improvement of <em>L'Art Po√©tique</em>. The last was, in turn, a combination of the <em>Ars Poetica</em> of Horace and of many well-known rules of the classicists.</p></div> </div>
