His <em>Cato</em>, with its classic unities and lack of dramatic power, must be regarded as a failure, if we study it as tragedy; but it offers an excellent example of the rhetoric and fine sentiment which were then considered the essentials of good writing. The best scene from this tragedy is in the fifth act, where Cato soliloquizes, with Plato's <em>Immortality of the Soul</em> open in his hand, and a drawn sword on the table before him:</p><blockquote class="  "><p>It must be so—Plato, thou reason'st well!—<br>Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,<br>This longing after immortality?<br>Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,<br>Of falling into nought? why shrinks the soul<br>Back on herself, and startles at destruction?<br>'Tis the divinity that stirs within</blockquote></div> </div>
