After fighting his country's battles, and at a time when most men were content with military honor, he began to learn Latin, that he might translate the works that would be most helpful to his people. His important translations are four in number: Orosius's Universal History and Geography, the leading work in general history for several centuries; Bede's History,  the first great historical work written on English soil; Pope Gregory's Shepherds' Book, intended especially for the clergy; and Boethius's Consolations of Philosophy, the favorite philosophical work of the Middle Ages.</li></ul><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Saxon Chronicle.More important than any translation is the <em>English</em> or <em>Saxon Chronicle</em>. This was probably at first a dry record, especially of important births and deaths in the West-Saxon kingdom. Alfred</p></div> </div>
