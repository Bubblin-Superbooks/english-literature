<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ul><li class="split-li ">Raleigh (1552?-1618) represents its adventurous spirit and activity. The life of Raleigh is an almost incomprehensible mixture of the poet, scholar, and adventurer; now helping the Huguenots or the struggling Dutch in Europe, and now leading an expedition into the unmapped wilds of the New World; busy here with court intrigues, and there with piratical attempts to capture the gold-laden Spanish galleons; one moment sailing the high seas in utter freedom, and the next writing history and poetry to solace his imprisonment. Such a life in itself is a volume far more interesting than anything that he wrote. He is the restless spirit of the Elizabethan Age personified.</li></ul><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Raleigh's chief prose works are the <em>Discoverie of Guiana</em>, a work which would certainly have been interesting enough had he told simply what he saw, but which was filled with colonization schemes and visions</p></div> </div>
