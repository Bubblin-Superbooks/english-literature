Rummaging through a cabinet one day in search of some fishing tackle, Scott found the manuscript of a story which he had begun and laid aside nine years before. He read this old story eagerly, as if it had been another's work; finished it within three weeks, and published it without signing his name. The success of this first novel, <em>Waverley</em> (1814), was immediate and unexpected. Its great sales and the general chorus of praise for its unknown author were without precedent; and when <em>Guy Mannering, The Antiquary, Black Dwarf, Old Mortality, Rob Roy</em>, and <em>The Heart of Midlothian</em> appeared within the next four years, England's delight and wonder knew no bounds. Not only at home, but also on the Continent, large numbers of these fresh and fascinating stories were sold as fast as they could be printed.</p></div> </div>
