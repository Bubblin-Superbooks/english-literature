<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">unconsciously immortalized the Puritan spirit, the same unconquerable spirit that set men to writing poems and allegories when in prison for the faith, and that sent them over the stormy sea in a cockleshell to found a free commonwealth in the wilds of America.</p><p>For a modern reader the understanding of <em>Paradise Lost</em> presupposes two things,â€”a knowledge of the first chapters of the Scriptures, and of the general principles of Calvinistic theology; but it is a pity to use the poem, as has so often been done, to teach a literal acceptance of one or the other. Of the theology of <em>Paradise Lost</em> the least said the better; but to the splendor of the Puritan dream and the glorious melody of its expression no words can do justice. Even a slight acquaintance will make the reader understand why it ranks with the <em>Divina Commedia</em> of Dante, and why it is generally accepted by critics as the greatest single poem in our literature.</p></div> </div>
