<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Early Poems and DramasExcept by the student, eager to understand the whoje range of poetry in this age, Tennyson's earlier poems and his later dramas may well be omitted. Opinions vary about both; but the general judgment seems to be that the earlier poems show too much of Byron's influence, and their crudeness suffers by comparison with the exquisitely finished work of Tennyson's middle life. Of dramatic works he wrote seven, his great ambition being to present a large part of the history of England in a series of dramas. <em>Becket</em> was one of the best of these works and met with considerable favor on the stage; but, like all the others, it indicates that Tennyson lacked the dramatic power and the humor necessary for a successful playwright.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Princess and MaudAmong the remaining poems there is such a wide variety that every reader must be left largely to follow his own delightful choice.</p></div> </div>
