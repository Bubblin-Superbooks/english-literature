The <em>Discourses in America</em> (1885) completes the list of his important works. At the height of his fame and influence he died suddenly, in 1888, and was buried in the churchyard at Laleham. The spirit of his whole life is well expressed in a few lines of one of his own early sonnets:)</p><blockquote><p>One lesson, Nature, let me learn of thee,<br>One lesson which in every wind is blown,<br>One lesson of two duties kept at one<br>Though the loud world proclaim their enmity—<br>Of toil unsever'd from tranquillity;<br>Of labour, that in lasting fruit outgrows<br>Far noisier schemes, accomplish'd in repose,<br>Too great for haste, too high for rivalry.  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
