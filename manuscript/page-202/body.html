<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The best known, though not the best, poem of the first period is the <em>Romaunt of the Rose</em>, a translation from the French <em>Roman de la Rose</em>, the most popular poem of the Middle Ages,—a graceful but exceedingly tiresome allegory of the whole course of love. The Rose growing in its mystic garden is typical of the lady Beauty. Gathering the Rose represents the lover's attempt to win his lady's favor; and the different feelings aroused—Love, Hate, Envy, Jealousy, Idleness, Sweet Looks—are the allegorical persons of the poet's drama. Chaucer translated this universal favorite, putting in some original English touches; but of the present <em>Romaunt</em> only the first seventeen hundred lines are believed to be Chaucer's own work.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Perhaps the best poem of this period is the "Dethe of Blanche the Duchesse," better known, as the "Boke of the Duchesse," a poem of considerable dramatic and emotional power, written after the death of Blanche,</p></div> </div>
