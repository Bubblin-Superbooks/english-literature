It breaks absolutely with the classical school and proclaims a literary declaration of independence.</p><p>In the third period Gray turns momentarily from his Welsh material and reveals a new field of romantic interest in two Norse poems, "The Fatal Sisters" and "The Descent of Odin" (1761). Gray translated his material from the Latin, and though these two poems lack much of the elemental strength and grandeur of the Norse sagas, they are remarkable for calling attention to the unused wealth of literary material that was hidden in Northern mythologv. To Gray and to Percy (who published his <em>Northern Antiquities</em> in 1770 is due in large measure the profound interest in the old Norse sagas which has continued to our own day.)</p></div> </div>
