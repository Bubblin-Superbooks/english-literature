<li>Works of Chaucer, First Period. The works of Chaucer are roughly divided into three classes, corresponding to the three periods of his life. It should be remembered, however, that it is impossible to fix exact dates for most of his works. Some of his <em>Canterbury Tales</em> were written earlier than the English period, and were only grouped with the others in his final arrangement.</li>
