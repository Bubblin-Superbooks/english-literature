<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">(1821), a rhapsody celebrating Platonic love, the most impalpable, and so one of the most characteristic, of all Shelley's works. It was inspired by a beautiful Italian girl, Emilia Viviani, who was put into a cloister against her will, and in whom Shelley imagined he found his long-sought ideal of womanhood. With this should be read <em>Adonais</em> (1821), the best known of all Shelley's longer poems. <em>Adonais</em> is a wonderful threnody, or a song of grief, over the death of the poet Keats. Even in his grief Shelley still preserves a sense of unreality, and calls in many shadowy allegorical figures,—Sad Spring, Weeping Hours, Glooms, Splendors, Destinies,—all uniting in bewailing the loss of a loved one. The whole poem is a succession of dream pictures, exquisitely beautiful, such as only Shelley could imagine; and it holds its place with Milton's <em>Lycidas</em> and Tennyson's <em>In Memoriam</em> as one of the three greatest elegies in our language.</p></div> </div>
