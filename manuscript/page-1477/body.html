<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>From <em>Andreas</em>, ll. 511 ff., a free translation. The whole poem thrills with the Old Saxon love of the sea and of ships.</p><p>From <em>Beowulf</em>, ll. 1063 ff., a free translation.</p><p>Translated from <em>The Husband's Message</em>, written on a piece of bark. With wonderful poetic insight the bark itself is represented as telling its story to the wife, from the time when the birch tree grew beside the sea until the exiled man found it and stripped the bark and carved on its surface a message to the woman he loved. This first of all English love songs deserves to rank with Valentine's description of Silvia:</p><blockquote><pre><code>                  Why, man, she is mine own,  </code></pre>
<p>And I as rich in having such a jewel<br>As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,<br>The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.<br><em>Two Gentlemen of Verona</em>, II, 4.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
