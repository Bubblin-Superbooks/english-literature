(Brooke).</p><p>Runes were primitive letters of the old northern alphabet. In a few passages Cynewulf uses each rune to represent not only a letter but a word beginning with that letter. Thus the rune-equivalent of C stands for <em>cene</em> (keen, courageous), Y for <em>yfel</em> (evil, in the sense of wretched), N for <em>nyd</em> (need), W for <em>ivyn</em> (joy), U for <em>ur</em> (our), L for <em>lagu</em> (lake), F for <em>feoh</em> (fee, wealth). Using the runes equivalent to these seven letters, Cynewulf hides and at the same time reveals his name in certain verses of <em>The Christ</em>, for instance:</p><blockquote><p>Then the <em>Courage-hearted</em> quakes, when the King (Lord he hears ) </p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>Speak to those who once on earth but obeyed Him</blockquote></div> </div>
