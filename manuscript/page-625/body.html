<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">undoubtedly the most powerful political satire in our language. Taking the Bible story of David and Absalom, he uses it to ridicule the Whig party and also to revenge himself upon his enemies. Charles II appeared as King David; his natural son, the Duke of Monmouth, who was mixed up in the Rye House Plot, paraded as Absalom; Shaftesbury was Achitophel, the evil Counselor; and the Duke of Buckingham was satirized as Zimri. The poem had enormous political influence, and raised Dryden, in the opinion of his contemporaries, to the front rank of English poets. Two extracts from the powerful characterizations of Achitophel and Zimri are given here to show the style and spirit of the whole work.</p><blockquote><pre><code>            (SHAFTESBURY ) </code></pre></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>Of these the false Achitophel was first;<br>A name to all succeeding ages</blockquote></div> </div>
