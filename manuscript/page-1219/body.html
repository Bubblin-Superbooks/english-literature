For the rest, we can only indicate those which, in our personal judgment, seem best worth reading,—<em>Bleak House, Dombey and Son, Our Mutual Friend</em>, and <em>Old Curiosity Shop</em>,—but we are not yet far enough away from the first popular success of these works to determine their permanent value and influence.</p><p>WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY (1811-1863)</p></div> </div>
