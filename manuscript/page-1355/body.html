All these are worthy of careful reading, but the best is "Thyrsis," a lament for the poet Clough, which is sometimes classed with Milton's <em>Lycidas</em> and Shelley's <em>Adonais</em>. Among the minor poems the reader will find the best expression of Arnold's ideals and methods in "Dover Beach," the love lyrics entitled "Switzerland," "Requiescat," "Shakespeare," "The Future," "Kensington Gardens," "Philomela," "Human Life," "Callicles's Song," "Morality," and "Geist's Grave."â€”the last being an exquisite tribute to a little dog which, like all his kind, had repaid our scant crumbs of affection with a whole life's devotion.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Essays in CriticismThe first place among Arnold's prose works must be given to the <em>Essays in Criticism</em>,</p></div> </div>
