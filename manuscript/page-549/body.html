<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">describes the separation of earth and water, and there is little or nothing added to the simplicity and strength of <em>Genesis</em>; but the sunset which follows is Milton's own dream, and instantly we are transported to a land of beauty and poetry:</p><blockquote><p>Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray<br>Had in her sober livery all things clad;<br>Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,<br>They to their grassy couch, these to their nests<br>Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale.<br>She all night long her amorous descant sung:<br>Silence was pleased. Now glowed the firmament<br>With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led<br>The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,<br>Rising in clouded majesty, at length<br>Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,<br>And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
