So the fear of hell was ingrained into an ignorant people for four centuries. Alternating with these horrors were bits of rough horse-play and domestic scenes of peace and kindliness, representing the life of the English fields and homes. With these were songs and carols, like that of the Nativity, for instance:</p><blockquote><p>As I out rode this enderes (last night, ) </p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>Of three jolly shepherds I saw a sight,<br>And all about their fold a star shone bright;<br>          They sang <em>terli terlow</em>,  
So merryly the shepherds their pipes can blow.<br>Down from heaven, from heaven so</blockquote></div> </div>
