In the "Monk's Tale" there is a melodious measure which may have furnished the model for Spenser's famous stanza. Chaucer's poetry is extremely musical and must be judged by the ear rather than by the eye. To the modern reader the lines appear broken and uneven; but if one reads them over a few times, he soon catches the perfect swing of the measure, and finds that he is in the hands of a master whose ear is delicately sensitive to the smallest accent. There is a lilt in all his lines which is marvelous when we consider that he is the first to show us the poetic possibilities of the language. His claim upon our gratitude is twofold: first, for discovering the music that is in our English speech; and second, for his influence in fixing the Midland dialect as the literary language of England.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
