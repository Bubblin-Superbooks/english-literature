Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Byron, and Scott had passed away, and it seemed as if there were no writers in England to fill their places. Wordsworth had written, in 1835,</p><blockquote><p>Like clouds that rake, the mountain summits,<br>    Or waves that own no curbing hand,<br>How fast has brother followed brother,<br>    From sunshine to the sunless land!  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
