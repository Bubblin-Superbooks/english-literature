It is the story of a youth, Dinias, who for love of a girl, Dercyllis, did heroic things and undertook many adventures, including a journey to the frozen north, and another to the moon. A second tale, <em>Ephesiaca</em>, is the story of a man and a maid, each of whom scoffs at love. They meet and fall desperately in love; but the course of true love does not run smooth, and they separate, and suffer, and go through many perils, before they "live happily ever after." This tale is the source of the medi√¶val story, <em>Apollonius of Tyre</em>, which is used in Gower's <em>Confessio Amantis</em> and in Shakespeare's <em>Pericles</em>. A third tale is the pastoral love story, <em>Daphnis and Chloe</em>, which reappeared in many forms in subsequent literature.</p><p>Minto's <em>Life of Defoe</em>, p. 139.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">These were not what the booksellers expected.
