    For thou dost soothe the heart, thou church of Rome,<br>By thy unwearied watch and varied round<br>    Of service, in thy Saviour's holy home.<br>I cannot walk the city's sultry streets,<br>But the wide porch invites to still retreats,<br>    Where passion's thirst is calmed, and care's unthankful gloom.  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
