Thus his Horton poems are joyous, almost Elizabethan in character; his prose is stern, militant, unyielding, like the Puritan in his struggle for liberty; his later poetry, following the apparent failure of Puritanism in the Restoration, has a note of sadness, yet proclaims the eternal principles of liberty and justice for which he had lived.</p><p>Of these sixty were taken from the Bible, thirty-three from English and five from Scotch history.</p><p>The latter was by Lewis Bayly, bishop of Bangor. It is interesting to note that this book, whose very title is unfamiliar to us, was speedily translated into five different languages. It had an enormous sale, and ran through fifty editions soon after publication.</p><p>Abridged from <em>Grace Abounding</em>, Part 3; <em>Works</em> (ed. 1873), p. 71.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For titles and publishers of reference works, see</p></div> </div>
